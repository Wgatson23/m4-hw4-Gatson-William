                <h2 id="about">About J. Cole</h2>
                <p>He was born Jermaine Lamarr Cole on January 28, 1985, in Frankfurt, Germany, to a European-American mother and an African-American father. He moved to Fayetteville, 
                    North Carolina with his mother when his father left the family.</p>
                <p>In pursuit of a better chance, he moved to New York City as soon as he graduated from high school, he enrolled in St. John's University on an academic scholarship, where he 
                    majored in communication and minored in business, graduating magna cum laude</p>
                <p>After Jay-Z heard his song "Lights Please." 
                    Cole was officially the first artist to be signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation.</p>
                    <hr>
                <h2 id="admire">Why I admire J. Cole</h2> 
                <p>I love his music because he can elicit strong emotional responses from his listeners, which few other rap artists can claim. Through his earnest storytelling, 
                    as he describes events and issues that he truly cares about, listeners develop a more intense connection 
                    with both Cole and the song itself simply for the emotions he evokes. </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="first">The first time hearing his music</h2>
                <p>In 2008, I was in the barbershop onboard USS George H.W. Bush in Norfolk, Virginia, and a coworker from Fayetteville, North Carolina, played his song “Dolla and a Dream” from his mixtape. From there, I started researching, and eventually, he became my 
                    favorite artist. Still, to this day, I listen to his mixtapes and old albums. </p>
